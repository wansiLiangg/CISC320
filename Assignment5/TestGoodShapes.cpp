/*
 * This is the equivalent program to that in the TestBadShapes.cpp file.  However, this
 * code is much nicer because it is able to use polymorphism with the Shape hierarchy.
 * You will also notice that the Shape constructors now contain the colours and text,
 * where applicable.
 *
 * This program will produce the same output as shown in the TestBadShapes.cpp file.
